## Where do I start?

I use [Spacemacs] as my [Emacs] distribution.

[Emacs] is just awesome, if you are interested in [Org-mode], I would advise you
to check this [OrgMode tutorial] and the [Using Emacs Series].

If you are already familiar with Emacs, you might probably want to check the
[init.el] file or the tangled org-babel [public-config.org] which is
self-documented.
